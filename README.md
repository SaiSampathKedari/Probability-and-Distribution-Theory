# Probability and Distribution Theory - Casella-Berger

This repository contains my **lecture notes** and solved problems from *Casella-Berger: Statistical Inference (Chapters 1-5)*, focused on foundational concepts in **Probability Theory** and **Statistical Inference**. These topics are essential for **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and **Robotics**.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Probability Theory**: Set theory, cardinality & countability, probability spaces, Borel sets, and Lebesgue measure.
2. **Transformations and Expectations**: Distributions of functions, moment-generating functions.
3. **Common Families of Distributions**: Discrete and continuous distributions, exponential families, inequalities.
4. **Multiple Random Variables**: Joint and marginal distributions, conditional distributions, mixture models.
5. **Properties of a Random Sample**: Sample mean, variance, order statistics, convergence, and random sampling.

## Repository Structure
- **Lecture Notes**: Theoretical concepts and theorems.
- **Problem Sets**: Solutions to exercises from *Casella-Berger* for reinforcing understanding.

## Purpose
These notes and solutions reflect my attempt to solidify my mathematical skills and understanding. I aim to build a strong theoretical foundation in **Statistical Inference**, which will support my future work in **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and **Robotics** research.

When I have the opportunity, I hope to document my notes and solutions in LaTeX for better clarity and organization.
